# GitHub Penetration Test Report

This repository contains a security assessment report created as a part of a university course project at the Faculty of Information Technology, Czech Technical University in Prague (ČVUT FIT).  
The goal of the project was to conduct a black-box penetration test on the GitHub platform, in accordance with GitHub’s public [Bug Bounty Program](https://bounty.github.com/#rules) and the [OWASP Web Security Testing Guide](https://owasp.org/www-project-web-security-testing-guide/).

## 📄 Report Overview

The penetration test focused on the publicly accessible GitHub web application. All testing was performed ethically and legally, targeting only test accounts and resources under tester control.

The test included:

- Identity management and registration flow analysis
- Session and cookie security inspection
- Enumeration of repositories and user data
- Input validation and injection vulnerability testing
- Cache behavior and authentication bypass attempts

The report includes vulnerability findings with CVSS 3.1 scoring, threat modeling, and detailed recommendations for remediation.

## 🔍 Key Findings

- **Session Token Stored in Browser Cache** – Risk of local session hijacking (High)
- **Email Address Enumeration via Password Reset** – Leakage of user presence (Medium)
- **Private Repository Enumeration via API status codes** – Object existence disclosure (Medium)
- **Post-logout Sensitive Data Access** – Cached data retrievable via browser (Low)
- **Weak Password Policy** – Allows passwords equal to email addresses (Informational)
